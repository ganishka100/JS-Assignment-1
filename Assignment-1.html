Q2.What are the JavaScript Engines ?

Ans2. JavaScript engines are software components that execute JavaScript code. They are
 responsible for interpreting and running JavaScript programs in web browsers, server-side
  environments, or other contexts. 
  Here are some of the prominent JavaScript:-

1.V8 (Chrome, Node.js)
2.SpiderMonkey (Firefox)
3.JavaScriptCore (Safari)
4.Chakra (Edge, deprecated)
5.Rhino (Java-based)
6.JerryScript
7.Deno (V8-based)

Q3. Explain ECMA in JS.

Ans3. ECMA stands for (European Computer Manufacturers Association).The official standard 
for JavaScript is called ECMAScript, and it is maintained by the ECMA organization.
 ECMAScript defines the core features of the JavaScript programming language. JavaScript
engines, such as V8 in Chrome, SpiderMonkey in Firefox, and JavaScriptCore in Safari,
implement the ECMAScript standard to ensure that JavaScript code behaves consistently
across different environments.

Q4. Why we use JavaScript? And also explain the history of JavaScript.

Ans4. JavaScript is a versatile and widely used programming language that is employed for
 web development.
 JavaScript is so popular and extensively used because of :
 1. Client-Side Scripting
 2.Web Browser Compatibility
 3.Enhanced User Experience
 4.Wide Range of Frameworks and Libraries
 5.Server-Side Development (Node.js)
 
 The father of JavaScript is Brendan Eich. He is an American technologist and programmer
 who created the JavaScript programming language while working at Nescape Communications
 Corporations in the mid-1990s. JavaScript was originally developed as a scripting language
 for web browsers and has since become one of the most widely used programming languages
 for both client-side and server-side web development.

Q5. What is DOM in JS.

 Ans5. The DOM, or Document Object Model, is a programming interface for web documents. It
represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects, where each object corresponds
to a part of the document, such as elements, attributes, and text content. The DOM 
provides a way for programs (like JavaScript) to manipulate the structure, style, and
content of web documents dynamically.
